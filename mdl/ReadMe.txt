Thanks for downloading fixed version of famous mdl decompiler by cannonfodder.

Place "MDL Decompiler Fixed.exe" in "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\***user_name***\sourcesdk\bin\ep1\bin"
If you are missing MFC71.DLL and getting error messages unpack mfc71.rar to the same location as "MDL Decompiler Fixed.exe"

This is patched version.
You don't have to mess with mdl files (No need to change "IDST0" to "IDST,").
