##How To Strap Up

Strapping up is very simple. Make sure you have Blender 2.66 or later.

In Blender:
- Select ```File > User Preferences```
- Move to the Addons tab
- Click Install From File... in the bottom of the window
- Find the downloaded zip file
- Find and check the Source Toolsâ€™ box. Wait a moment for activation to complete.
- Click Save User Settings.

Then extract the ```gcfscape185.zip```, so you can use the gcfscape program.

Then ```cd``` into the ```\mdl``` directory and follow the instructions in the readme file there.
